## A touchscreen digital media frame whose name is an homage to [PiPresents](https://pipresents.wordpress.com/)

I couldn't find a digital media frame that did all the things I wanted, so I made my own. This software is made for a touchscreen to do the following:

* Show both images and video
* Have sound for the video
* Have the tracks be shuffled in a random order
* Be able to annotate the images and videos with text
* Be able to navigate through the tracks using the touchscreen
* Use the touchscreen to be able to unmute and mute videos
* Have a motion sensor so that the software pauses and turns the monitor off when there has been no motion for a set amount of time, and then unpauses and turns on monitor when there is motion
* Be able to handle thousands of images and video
* Have all the hardware fit on the back of the monitor
* Be able to mount the monitor to the wall
* Use a full size monitor
* No soldering

Currently, this software only works on the Pi3 running Raspbian. Below are instructions on how to assemble the hardware (i.e., monitor, Pi, motion sensor, external hard drive) as well as how to set up and run the software.
