## A touchscreen digital media frame whose name is an homage to [PiPresents](https://pipresents.wordpress.com/)

I couldn't find a digital media frame that did all the things I wanted, so I made my own. This software is made for a touchscreen to do the following:

* Show both images and video
* Have sound for the video
* Have the tracks be shuffled in a random order
* Be able to annotate the images and videos with text
* Be able to navigate through the tracks using the touchscreen
* Use the touchscreen to be able to unmute and mute videos
* Have a motion sensor so that the software pauses and turns the monitor off when there has been no motion for a set amount of time, and then unpauses and turns on monitor when there is motion
* Be able to handle thousands of images and video
* Have everything fit on the back of the monitor
* Be able to mount the monitor to the wall
* Use a full size monitor

Currently, this software only works on the Pi3.
